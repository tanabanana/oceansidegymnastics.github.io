        <h2>Pre-School</h2>

                <h3>Lil' Hoppers</h3>
                <p>45 minutes - In this parent and toddler class for children walking to 3 years old, an instructor teaches the parent and the parent teaches the child. Students will develop a longer attention span, better body movement and concept understanding.</p>
                    <pre class="center" >5 weeks, 1x a week: $88    -    10 weeks, 1x a week: $159</pre>
                    <pre class="center" >5 weeks, 2x a week: $147    -    10 weeks, 2x a week: $266</pre>

                <h3>Pre-Cricket</h3>
                <p>45 minutes - This class is for children 3 to 4.5 years old; this level emphasizes the development of positive social and emotional skills, independent thinking, body awareness, relationships and directionality. Students learn rolls, basic jumps, hops, body positions and much more. At this level the child is mentally capable of participation without a parent. They begin the early stages of sequencing with simple obstacle courses.</p>
                    <pre class="center" >5 weeks, 1x a week: $92    -    10 weeks, 1x a week: $166</pre>

                <h3>Cricket</h3>
                <p>50 minutes - This class is for children 4.5 to 5.5 years old; your child's development of strength, sequencing and responding to visual cues are emphasized at this level. Children learn beginning handstands, leaps, body positions, skill names and much more. The student will learn to do a backward roll down a wedge-shaped mat, a seat drop on the trampoline, and is ready to learn cartwheels.</p>

                <h3>Cartwheels &amp; Round-Offs</h3>
                <p>60 minutes - This is the level at which we separate the boys and the girls so that they can work on their own apparatus specialties. Students work foundation skills on all Olympic events and trampoline, including cartwheels and round-offs on floor, walks, jumps and holds on beam, strength and swings on bars, basic squat and straddle on vault, and trampoline for body awareness.</p>
                    <pre class="center" >5 weeks, 1x a week: $100    -    10 weeks, 1x a week: $180</pre>
                    <pre class="center" >5 weeks, 2x a week: $167    -    10 weeks, 2x a week: $301</pre>

                <h3>Kips</h3>
                <p>60 minutes - Now that the foundation skills have been set, some of the more advanced skills start to show themselves in the form of entry level drills. The students work bridge kickovers, front and back walkovers, and form the beginnings of front and back handsprings. They learn basic swings and back hip circles on bars, handsprings on vault, cartwheels and handstands on beam, and much more.</p>
                    <pre class="center" >5 weeks, 1x a week: $100    -    10 weeks, 1x a week: $180</pre>

                <h3>Aerials</h3>
                <p>90 minutes - Students start to perfect their back walkovers and back handsprings. They continue cartwheels on the beam and move to new heights on the bars. Basic flips are learned on the trampolines.</p>
                    <pre class="center" >5 weeks, 1x a week: $111    -    10 weeks, 1x a week: $200</pre>
                    <pre class="center" >5 weeks, 2x a week: $186    -    10 weeks, 2x a week: $334</pre>

                <p>60 minutes - We understand that this is the age at which boys really don't want to be in a class with all girls. Our boys class gives the boys a space of their own to work on their skills on the men's Olympic events and trampoline.</p>
                    <pre class="center" >5 weeks, 1x a week: $100    -    10 weeks, 1x a week: $180</pre>

    	<h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
    		
    			<h4 class="question">How many days a week should I register my recreational gymnast?</h4>
    				<p class="answer">Knowing your gymnast's goals is important. Are they looking to gain skills and eventually join a gymnastics, cheer, or dance team? Or are they looking for a fun way to have fun while working out? </p>
    				<p class="answer">1 Day per week : A great way to introduce gymnastics as a new sport or develop and advance skills with lower time commitment. </p>
    				<p class="answer">2 Days per week: Good for a gymnast who is determined and looking for quicker skill progression. </p>
    				<p class="answer">3 Days per week: Best for gymnasts looking for accelerated skill development with possibility of transferring to a team program. </p>
    			<h4 class="question">When will my gymnast progress to the next level?</h4>
    				<p class="answer">Safety is our priority; our coaches assess a gymnast's skill development each class.  Once a gymnast demonstrates proficiency in their skills and can navigate independently through circuits, your gymnast will be prepared to learn more difficult skills safely.</p>
    			<h4 class="question">Can we make changes to our class schedule?</h4>
    				<p class="answer">Should it become necessary to change your class day/time, please contact our office.  We are happy to assist you in finding a new class to fit your schedule. Classes can be switched once per session. </p>
